# Road signs recognition, with use of neural networks.
This repo shows different approaches related to the use of neural networks, used to road signs recognition, datasets with German road signs available on the Kaggle website are used as data. 
First, a preliminary graphic processing is performed in which images are saved without colour changes, even with a possible alpha channel, and one size for all images is specified. 
The used algorithm is based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are also in use, part of neural network is used as an image encoder, which will give the other machine learning algorithms the characteristics of road signs as learning data. 
At the end all of the work with neural networks is summarized, with use of some plots.
